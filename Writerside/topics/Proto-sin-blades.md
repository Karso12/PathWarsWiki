Overview.

The High-Vale blades were crafted in High-Vale, the mountaintop cities of the Runewild elves.

There are 7 High-Vale blades throughout the Runewild.

Each High-Vale blade is a +2 Striking Longsword.

Each High-Vale blade is a level 10 item.

Each High-Vale blade has a unique name and a unique property.

High-Vale Shifting.

Each High-Vale blade has a shifting rune.

This can also be done as a free action outside combat.

Note: After every combat encounter, high vale blades return to their original longsword form.

The High-Vale Ritual.

During daily preparations or by spending 1 minute later in the day, a high-vale blade wielder can copy their High-Vale blades +2 potency and striking rune to a single weapon of their choice.

This has to be repeated each day or 24 hours (whichever comes first).

NOTE:

The weapon empowered by the ritual still retains its normal potency and striking runes.

When you empower a weapon make sure to note down what the weapon’s normal runes are.

If your longbow is +1 striking, make sure to write that down before setting the runes on Foundry to be +2 striking.

High-Vale Dual class.

The High-Vale blades were created by one of the greatest magical users of all time.

The soul opens up to the possibilities that have always lingered within itself.
