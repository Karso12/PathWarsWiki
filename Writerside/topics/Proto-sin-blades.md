## Overview.

The High-Vale blades were crafted in High-Vale, the mountaintop cities of the Runewild elves.

There are 7 High-Vale blades throughout the Runewild.

Each High-Vale blade is a +2 Striking Longsword.

Each High-Vale blade is a level 10 item.

Each High-Vale blade has a unique name and a unique property.

## High-Vale Shifting.

Each High-Vale blade has a shifting rune.

This can also be done as a free action outside combat.

Note: After every combat encounter, high vale blades return to their original longsword form.

The High-Vale Ritual.

During daily preparations or by spending 1 minute later in the day, a high-vale blade wielder can copy their High-Vale blades +2 potency and striking rune to a single weapon of their choice.

This has to be repeated each day or 24 hours (whichever comes first).

NOTE:

The weapon empowered by the ritual still retains its normal potency and striking runes.

When you empower a weapon, make sure to note down what the weapon’s normal runes are.

If your longbow is +1 striking, make sure to write that down before setting the runes on Foundry to be +2 striking.

High-Vale Dual class.

The High-Vale blades were created by one of the greatest magical users of all time.

Wielding a high-vale blade unlocks within the wielder's soul the potential to wield twice as much power as their soul would regularly allow them to wield.

The soul opens up to the possibilities that have always lingered within itself.

If you have planar blood, it may awaken your sorcerer power.

If you practised with a weapon every day but didn't have enough power to wield the weapon as a master alongside another classification then you may become a fighter.

If you have studied the arcane methodologies, theorems and lore, then perhaps you shall become a wizard.
