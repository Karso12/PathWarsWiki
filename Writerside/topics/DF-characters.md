>> - Any other family: a little brother who she doted on until he disappeared with her parents

>> - hair length: slightly below shoulder-length, tied into a bun and stuffed into her hood most of the time
>> - physique: she is lithe and has more recently built up fairly impressive musculature from training with her bow, she tends to wear loose leather armour and a cloak, so not much can be determined about her figure, though the way it falls does suggest quite wide hips.

- Classes: Magus & Gunslinger. Multiclass: Investigator.
- Carnon GH repo: https://github.com/Karso12/Carnon-Backstory/tree/main/untitled/Writerside/topics/Lore%20Generator

- What does your character look like?

	2. The head is immobile with gemstones for the eyes.
	3. The torso is covered in multiple layers of metal cords,
	4. but two spots reveal a smooth black surface beneath, with blue markings that look like drawn-on eyes.
	5. The cords extend down their arms, ending several inches above the wrist.
	6. Below that is a fabric that hangs almost down to their knees.

**Backstory.**

- Carnon the Magus Gunslinger, the Corrector Conrasus began in a small druidic grove; the grove begged the skies for
  protection.
- PROTECT THEM FROM WHAT?
- Carnon's Aeon sent them to the druids.
- During their time in the grove they grew their Magus powers with great success.
- Upon completing his training, Gallrock the Arch Druid of the grove grew from the earth a band of force.
- During their years, they became curious about the stories they heard of explosions harnessed inside metal.
- This was not knowledge the druids had.
- Eventually, as the Grove prospered and grew, his services were deemed redundant.
- The deciding factor was a manticore attack, a manticore that was beaten before Carnon was able to make it to the scene.
- Carnon took a trophy from the manticore's corpse as a reminder to keep growing.
- They decided the best way to serve their Aeon was to research further into the story of these explosions.
- His research led him to a coastal city, where they, through much persuasion, managed to land an apprenticeship
  with a gunsmith named Belron.
- They learned the craft with much fervour, applying much of their Magus weapons training, and teachings the Druids gave them.
- They were able to create a powerful firearm that utilized the Manticore trophy.
- During an excursion into a different city to peddle the wares their Mentor Belron the Gunsmith had crafted, Belron
  The gunsmith was attacked inside his store.
- Upon returning to their Store, Carnon found it burnt down, and his mentor Belron the Gunsmith was slain.
- With their great skill in Smithing, Gunnery, and the arcane Arts, Carnon was recruited into the city's Guard.
- This served Carnon, as they mentored under the city Investigator: Opus The Investigator.
- Opus The Investigator helped him pursue leads to what happened to their Mentor Belron the Gunsmith's store.
- Eventually, the case had grown cold, but Carnon stayed on with the guards for several more years.
- During one investigation, the clues lead to Carnon being the perpetrator of several murders.
- Not being able to clear their name, Carnon fled on a ship, leaving the town.
- They spent some months on this ship where they learned from an esoteric man the secrets that certain crystals
  possess, this is how Carnon learned crystal healing.
- The ship eventually made port in a town/place where the character will be introduced to the party.

**Plot threads.**

- Why does your character adventure?\
  They are currently on the run from a city guard, but they also want to collect knowledge for their Aeon.

- Ideas:
	1. Create/find the world's greatest firearm.
	2. What are your thoughts on civilisation/forms of civilisation?
	   Not biased.
	   Druidic way of life is self-sufficient.
	   The groves are well protected, but they are too isolationist.
	3. Civic Guard Druid.
	4. Interest in Irespan? Living stone = Living wood, create a city-living golem.
	5. Can hear crystals talking/connected to other crystals.
	6. Hell knight of the mask?
	7. Maybe the grove was in Numeria, the same grove as Allisee's armour was from.
	8. Met Dr Boojuu on the boat to Riddleport.

- Plot Threads.
	1. Hell knights coming after Carnon.
	2. Figuring out what the non-city whispers are.
	3. Who killed Belron the Gunsmith / burned down the store?
	4. Why did Queen Cressida Croft reinstate the bounty?
	5. Obtaining high-tech equipment: weapons, armour, etc.
	6. Helping Numerian druids weave together greater high-tech equipment with their primal magic.
	7. Make Numeria safe/great again. Reduce the threat to the local populace (druids and the town of Torch).
	8. Why is Carnon pulled so strongly towards the shards of sin/aeon stones?
	9. Who is the Aeon?
