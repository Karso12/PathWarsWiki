## Rune wheel.

> By Ross.

So they ended the seagull island arc, and as a result found this weird thing.

After Tammerhawk and a few other great arcane minds spent time researching it,
they found out they can use the rune wheel as a sort of window into the past. 

We would be experiencing it sort of like actors without a script,
being where we are supposed to be without knowing exactly what our role is.

Tammerhawk ended up spending an entire fortune and like,
every even mildly magical man (I mean seriously, she included carnon in the ritual) to activate it.
Then asked us to view the past and help her sort out her memories.

We are searching for the Scarab jewels? Each is priceless and a powerful magical artifact with the ability to unlock the ancient knowledge and magic of Ancient Osiria. Amemphious believes that the lack of these jewels him impotent. The diamond sage has these jewels? In the something desert. The diamond sage is necessary to conduct the Ritual of the Jewels. Amephious has other leads. This city is strange, and has magical protections that will raise alarms should we teleport into this city. Ancient stone walls surround Etho, they are magically warded, hundreds of metres tall and are impossible to climb. Go into the city, meet with the information broker. Find the Diamond Sage. House of the White Urius. Not near the slums. Rich part of the city.
