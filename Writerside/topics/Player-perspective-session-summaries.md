Osiria Arc pt 1.
Home of the [[Jewelled Sages]]. 

There is a dead spawn of Rovagog. Beetle that was slain by many mages. The shell of this beetle has a city around it.

Feathered Turban.

We are searching for the Scarab jewels? Each is priceless and a powerful magical artifact with the ability to unlock the ancient knowledge and magic of Ancient Osiria. Amemphious believes that the lack of these jewels him impotent. The diamond sage has these jewels? In the something desert. The diamond sage is necessary to conduct the Ritual of the Jewels. Amephious has other leads. This city is strange, and has magical protections that will raise alarms should we teleport into this city. Ancient stone walls surround Etho, they are magically warded, hundreds of metres tall and are impossible to climb. Go into the city, meet with the information broker. Find the Diamond Sage. House of the White Urius. Not near the slums. Rich part of the city.


Carnon gets the contact information of a City Guide. There is pregnant griffin around? Mahoo the Gate Keeper Customs Agent is a challenging boss, but through MANY meandering checks we eventually ended up crafting a fake geode, and gave it to them to hold it. Etho Bazaar is where merchants wouldn't try to scam non-locals. He goes through us one by one. Selenor is undead and necromancer scum, but necromancer scum is allowed! The ultimate authority on Pharasma is in the capital city of Osiria. Inebni Andabar. Nercomancer scum might be interested in The Grand Library ran by Khamos Al-Awlaq.  The most powerful follower of Lemashtu lives in the hills. 8th rank spellcaster. MAHOO TAKES CARNONS HERBS AND SPICES. Mahoo gives the party a Merchants Docket. We don't get XP for defeating this boss. :( House of the White Cobra. Viole harasses a pompous local who is able to point us in the right direction. Carnon is sent to the Osirian Blacksite, because they wouldn't remove their skin. Liar joins them. The main group is given alcohol, Selenor gives Cardigan alcohol then remembers that Cardigan goes into a murderous and lustful rage if she drinks alcohol. Allisee gives Cardigan hottub water instead of Alcohol, it tastes like toe cheese.

Torch of the Shadow Wizard Money Gang gives us tasks. When completed, we will learn about the Diamond Sage.
-Slip a book into Professor Lozar's Belongings. School of Sciences.
