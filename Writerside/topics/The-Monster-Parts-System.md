# The Monster Parts System

**The monster parts system is based on the system from the batlezoo bestiary**

## Basics:
Each monster defeated can be harvested for "monster parts" .
These parts have a value dependent on the size and level of the monster and also have a bulk value(dependent on size).

These parts can be used to craft items instantaneously as per the rules described in the PDF here

You don't need to use specific parts for specific things(no restrictions on imbuement or types of items craftable in this way based on the monster:



## Changes:

These parts can also be used to create items in the same way from the books that aren't runes or rune based items. 

Using monster parts to craft these items costs 2x the item's price and the item becomes imbued with an imbuement of your choice (appropriate for the type of item) from the monster part rules equal to the level of the item.
This is different from crafting as it doesn't take a skill check or time.
