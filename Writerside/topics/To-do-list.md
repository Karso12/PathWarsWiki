>> - Jumina Arc summary
       - I vote you make selenor do it, since it's his arc  </sub>
>> - Character Glossary in github 
       - This will be really helpful for new players, and once it's started the players can fill it out and keep it updated. A name, a description and their plot relenece would be enough </sub>
>> - Clean up discord server 
       - You have two bots keeping track of levels for no reason other than novelty, turn them both off or keep one active for lols, and move their level up messages to the botspam channel. 
         Add a note in the #join the campaign channel that discord is not the ideal place to reach you, and you're a busy person so you might not respond immediately
>> - Remove +1 ability rings from foundry and update the relevent section of the starting guide with what they need to do without it.
>> - Give Carnon a magic item
>> - Fill Dishwasher salt

>> - Prepare for next session (Characters, Monsters, Locations, Maps, Loot)
>> - Meal prep food so you don't have to cook mid session
>> - Create a factions page so players can keep track and collaborate info about factions
>> - Create a Locations page so players can keep track and collaborate info about locations
>> - Gauntlight Arc Summary?
