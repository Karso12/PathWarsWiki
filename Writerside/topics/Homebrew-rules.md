# Homebrew-rules

For the official Paizo homebrew rules we use: [Variant-rules.md](Variant-rules.md)

## 5 plot threads.

Every main character should have 5 plot threads.

These will be created during the conversation between new players and the game master.

## Champions: Healing touch AND touch of corruption!

Champions get both, so they have more fun options in combat!

## Initiative.

Combat starts.

If the party is fighting a boss enemy, then the enemy round is first.

Otherwise, the party round is first.

The party round starts with either the main character that makes the most sense / most cinematic to go first.
Alternatively, the party can strategise who should go first and decide amongst themselves.

When a main character has finished its turn, the player of that character then picks which main character goes next.
This can be accompanied by an in-character request for help, or a prompt to ask:
- "Sir Lancelot, strike down this ogre!"
- "Cardigan, heal my wounds!"

## Lore Increases.

A lore increase is a skill increase that can only be applied to lore skills.

Every time you get a skill increase as part of your character’s class progression, you get a lore increase.

This also applies to Rogues with their increased frequency of skill increases.

Rogues get a lore increase every time they get a skill increase.

- 3: Expert.
- 5: Expert.
- 7: Master.
- 9: Master.
- 11: Master.

## Main and side characters.

If the character is controlled by a player, it is a "main character."
If the character is controlled by the game master, it is a "side character."

## Spellcasting overhaul

1. Once you prepare a spell in a single slot you can cast it at any heightened level at the cost of a spell of that level.
2. Once you cast a spell you can continue casting that spell with other spell slots even if the prepared slot is expended. 
3. All spell slots of the same tradition are combined into a single pool for the purposes of preparation. This includes spell slots from any source such as class, archetypes, etc.

Basically prepared spellcasters have flexible spellcasting without the drawbacks of loosing spell slots and spontaneous casters have all their spells counted as signature spells for the purpose of heightening.

Example of Rule #1.

You are a 9th-level wizard.

You have spell slots up to 5th level spell slots.

You have prepared Fireball in one of your 3rd level spell slots.

You can cast Fireball in any of your 3rd level spell slots as normal.

The change is that you can also cast Fireball in any of your higher-level spell slots even if Fireball is not prepared in those spell slots.

In this example, you can expend a 4th or 5th-level spell slot to cast a fireball.

You still use up the higher level expended slot.

Example of Rule #2.

If you have a fireball prepared in a spell slot you can continue casting the fireball spell in other spell slots that don’t have the fireball spell even after the fireball slot has been expended.

 Example of Rule #3.

A dual class Magus + Wizard called Bob is preparing their spells.

Both Magus and Wizard are of the arcane tradition.

This means that if Bob prepared fireball in Bob’s Magus spell slots then Bob could cast fireball using any of his Magus spell slots and any of his wizard spell slots.

If Bob’s classes didn't have matching traditions (such as primal and divine) then Rule #3 does not apply.

Bob would then need to prepare heal twice: once in primal and once in divine.
