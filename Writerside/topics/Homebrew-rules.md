For the official Paizo homebrew rules we use: [Variant-rules.md](Variant-rules.md)

## Initiative.

Combat starts.

If the party is fighting a boss enemy, then the enemy round is first.

Otherwise, the party round is first.

The party round starts with either the main character that makes the most sense / most cinematic to go first.
Alternatively, the party can strategise who should go first and decide amongst themselves.

When a main character has finished its turn, the player of that character then picks which main character goes next.
This can be accompanied by an in-character request for help, or a prompt to ask:
- "Sir Lancelot, strike down this ogre!"
- "Cardigan, heal my wounds!"
