# Getting-started-guide

## REQUIREMENT #1 = ONLY JOIN IF YOU ARE 18+

## REQUIREMENT #2 = ONLY JOIN IF YOU CAN COMMIT TO MULTIPLE SESSIONS + SHOW UP TO SESSIONS + PLAY IN THE LONG TERM.

## REQUIREMENT #3 = ONLY JOIN IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONTENT GUIDE.

## Welcome!

Hello Pathfinder newbie!

If you are reading this, you probably want to join one of the currently running Path Wars Pathfinder 2e campaigns.

This is a guide that will hopefully result in you being ready to play.

Just follow each section, complete each part, and you will be ready to play.

**Help.**

If you need any help, please reach out to the GM on Telegram or Discord.

## Before we go any further...

PLEASE READ STEP 0.

## Step #0 = Content Warning.

## Unlocking the Discord.

At the moment you will only be seeing a couple of public channels on the server, including the lobby.

To unlock the rest of the server, please read the rest of the page.

The ‚ÄúWhat To do Now‚Äù heading contains further information.

## Why did I add step 0?

After GMing for a long time, you come to realise that different people have different levels of tolerance for all kinds of different things.

The intent of step 0 is to ensure that you as a potential new player are well are of possible in-game events, and the types of interpersonal interactions that can occur.

This explanation is for the benefit of everyone
as everyone is on the same page when it comes to expressing themselves without fear of upsetting someone else.

Mostly it‚Äôs just edgy jokes.

## 18+

Before you can join any Path Wars campaign, you must be 18+.

If you are under 18, then I am afraid we cannot and will not let you play.

Most players will be in their 20s and do not want to play with children.

If you are under 18: PLEASE LEAVE THE DISCORD SERVER AND TELEGRAM GROUP.

## What to do now!

1. Please read the rest of step 0. This step describes the possible content that could come up in-game.
2. Please decide if you consent to this content being possibly in the game.
3. Please mention ‚Äú@PathWars‚Äù on discord in the ‚Äú#guest‚Äù text channel.
4. Then please let PathWars know that you are OK with this content possibly occurring in-game + over voice.
5. Then PathWars will give you the campaign role which will unlock the rest of the server.

## Possible Content. The content guide checklist.

The list of possible things is taken from ‚ÄúThe Digital RPG Consent Checklist‚Äù.

The link to the safety checklist can be found here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J4Xd-HEQdBoeX8uOeYL-Xp5mTCjB4JXhrKe8hlnLkj8/edit#heading=h.4fgbplrlzok0

This checklist is a safety tool created to ensure a safe gaming environment.

A big thank you to the tool for ensuring happy gaming.

I am using it here because I think it covers *nearly* every possible event that could possibly occur in a campaign.

## How Do You Feel About the Permanent Death of Player Characters?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm OK with it.‚Äù

You need to be OK with the fact that your character may die and that your character may be permanently dead.

While resurrection is often an option, there are many instances where it is not feasible,
or the party decides not to resurrect your character.

This needs to be accepted before play can begin.

## How Do You Feel About the Permanent Death of Significant NPCs?

You need to be OK with the fact that significant NPCs may die and be permanently dead.

## Slavery.

All of the above comes from the RPG Safety kit.

I am adding slavery as my own custom addition as it is part of the campaign world setting.

This means that slavery can often come up.

You need to be OK with:

1. Slavery exists.
2. Players or NPCs own slaves.

This is all I think of in regard to slavery.
If anyone has any suggestions on how the slavery content list could be expanded, please let me know.

## Comedy.

I‚Äôve also added this section.

Jokes are subjective, so please be OK with jokes of any kind, any subject, etc.

I, myself, enjoy dark and edgy humour. 
However, I know that it isn't for everyone.

That is why
it is important to acknowledge this
and ensure
people are prepared for the possibility of jokes
being made by anyone involved in the campaign or from the community as a whole.

## Suggestions.

If you have any ideas on how to extend this out, please let me know.

Telegram is the best way to reach me.

## Become Social!

The first steps are the socials we use to organise the sessions and to chat about Pathfinder and other stuff.

üòÉ

## Step #1 = Telegram

### Telegram

We used Telegram for out-of-game chat, and some in-session links and image sharing.

The link to the Telegram group is below.

All the links do the same thing.

### Group Link.

Click the link below:

[Telegram](https://www.notion.so/Telegram-c5939cd59b2c4064bdf2b097e62f6a09?pvs=21)

## Step #2 = Discord.

Discord invite link.

Normal link:

https://discord.gg/nAxna2DBk7

## Establishing The Character‚Äôs Lore.

With these steps, we will establish the character alongside their backstory, traits, appearance and more!

## Step #3 = The Great Spoiler Warning.

Read = [Spoiler Avoidance Guide](https://www.notion.so/Spoiler-Avoidance-Guide-03ce3d0582564a958e974cdea133113e?pvs=21)

## Step #4 = How to Build Your Character‚Äôs Life.

Go here and paste the table onto your Notion Workspace:

[Build YOUR Character‚Äôs Life HERE! Character-Lore-Builder.md](Character-Lore-Builder.md)

If you need information on the world, check out:
[Golarion-Lore-The-Spoiler-Free-Version](Golarion-Lore-The-Spoiler-Free-Version.md)

## OPTIONAL: GitHub.

- Put your character's lore into a Writerside project.
- Create a GitHub repo.
- Push up your project.
- Share it with me! :)

***Now you know what your character is like!***

I can‚Äôt wait to meet them. üòÉ

End of Page.

## Learn the rules.

It is time to learn!
Don‚Äôt worry, this is the fun kind of learning.
You can learn as you go!

## Step #5 = Paizo Variant Rules.

Please read the following:

The rules in this table are the rules in play in each campaign.

When you are making your character later in this guide, you need to keep the Variant rules in mind.

For example.

Most of the campaigns that I run use:

1. Dual Class
2. Free Archetype

You can find out what Paizo Variant rules are used in the table linked above!

The campaigns ran in the Path War community have some homebrew rule changes.

You can find a mostly complete list of the rule changes here.

[Homebrew Rule Changes.](Homebrew-rules.md)

## Step #6 = Talk to the Game Master, me!

Reach out to me.
Share your built-up character's lore.
We will integrate your character into the campaign.

Check out my 5 plot threads rule on [Homebrew-rules.md](Homebrew-rules.md).
I will go through this with you to integrate you into the campaign.

## Make the character.

The next steps are all about making the character.

## Step #7 = **3rd Party Content.**

Next step.

[Step 10 | Path Builder 2e + Character Creation.](https://www.notion.so/Step-10-Path-Builder-2e-Character-Creation-a17ebea80eb24e65a2f70298d4ac2814?pvs=21)

**3rd Party Content.**

Check the 3rd party page to find out what is available.

[3rd Party Content.](https://www.notion.so/3rd-Party-Content-7bd26049ed604612b331daeaac49d9b7?pvs=21)

[Step 10 | Path Builder 2e + Character Creation.](https://www.notion.so/Step-10-Path-Builder-2e-Character-Creation-a17ebea80eb24e65a2f70298d4ac2814?pvs=21)

## Step #8 = Path Builder 2e + Character Creation.

Time to actually make your character‚Äôs stats and abilities.

[Pathbuilder 2e Setup.](https://www.notion.so/Pathbuilder-2e-Setup-c43e1441d38d452b839ea6c36bcfd069?pvs=21)

The link to Path-Builder is here:

[Pathbuilder 2e](https://pathbuilder2e.com/app.html)

**Go on Path-Builder.**

Go to Path-Builder's character builder web application.

**Enable the variant rules.**

Enable the variant rules that are applicable to your campaign.

To find out what variant rules you need to enable, check here:

[Variant-rules](Variant-rules.md)

**How to enable the variant rules.**

To enable variant rules on Path-Builder 2e do the following:

Options ‚Üí Then Tick the Box next to the rule.

For dual-class it would be:

Options ‚Üí Tick the Dual Class box.

## **NOTE ABOUT = Selecting 3rd party content: **

3rd Party content will not be selectable in Path-Builder 2e due to it not being official Paizo content.

To use 3rd party content, you will need to add it in Foundry manually.

Contact your GM about this as some 3rd party content may already be available in Foundry thanks to community modules.

## **NOTE ABOUT = Uncommon, Rare and Unique equipment, feats, spells and races.**

Before selecting anything with these traits, make sure you read:

[Rarity-Lock-Status-Tracker.md = Uncommon/Rare/Unique.](Rarity-Lock-Status-Tracker.md)

**Create your character.**

To create your character, set your character to the level they will be playing at.

To find out what level your character should be, go to the section on this notion that has that campaign.

Now: Pick your class, pick your race and pick your subrace.

Go through each level and apply all your ability score boosts, make your feat selections, etc.

## **Pick your equipment.**

[Starting Items Table!](https://www.notion.so/Starting-Items-Table-14c2d3b094e443febac7b933a6dd0b2d?pvs=21)

This page explains what items you start with.

You need to consult the table by using your level to determine what equipment you start with.

**Apply lore increases.**

You can read about the lore increases homebrew rule here:

[Lore Increases in Homebrew-rules.md](Homebrew-rules.md)

## Buy the Full Version of Path-Builder 2e.

Buying the full version of Path-builder 2e is worth it.

All the campaigns on this server are multi-year 100+ session campaigns, you will get your value for money.

Using Path-Builder 2e ensures that you build your character correctly without missing out important steps.

## Foundry Virtual Table Top Time.

It is time to get started on getting you set up on Foundry.

The following steps will get you ready for Foundry!

## Step #9 = Download Chrome OR Use Edge.

## Download Link

[Google Chrome - Download the fast, secure browser from Google](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/)

## The Bad News

Foundry is made to work with Chrome.

Chrome will offer you the best performance.
Chrome will offer you the best user experience.

Chrome isn't my favourite browser either.

## The Good News

Once you get into Foundry on Chrome, you will install Foundry.

After that, you will be using Foundry as an application.

**OR**

You can use Microsoft Edge to do the same thing!

You can both use Foundry and install it using Edge.

Either one is totally fine. üòÉ

## Step #10 = What is the Forge?

This step will get you set up on the Forge.

What is the Forge?

The Forge is a server-hosting platform.

The Forge hosts Foundry worlds.

We play Pathfinder 2e on Foundry.

I pay per a month to have the Foundry world hosted on the forge.

## Step #11 = Join The Forge Campaign

Ask for a Forge invite link.

You need to create an account.

Once you have done that, you will be an official player in the campaign.

Done?
Congratulations you are now on Foundry and an official player!

### ‚ÄúBUT THIS LINK DOESN'T WORK!!!‚Äù

If the link doesn't work, just ask on the telegram for a new one.

## Step #12 = Request a Foundry User.

Now that you have a Forge account, you can launch the game.

This will take you to the Foundry login screen.

To log into Foundry, you need a Foundry User.

Foundry users must be created manually by the Foundry Admin.

Request a Foundry user on the telegram group, and I will create a user for you.

## Step #13 = Log into Foundry.

Watch this video before using Foundry VTT.

[Step 16 | Install Foundry.](https://www.notion.so/Step-16-Install-Foundry-6bb20fc0486549489f62719c1e30a026?pvs=21)

## Step #14 = Install Foundry.

Tired of asking what the link to get onto Foundry is?

Well, this is one of the benefits of installing Foundry VTT.

Article explanation:

[What is "The Forge: More Awesomeness" module?](https://forums.forge-vtt.com/t/what-is-the-forge-more-awesomeness-module/16836)

Click the button.

Video showing the application:

## Step #15= Pick your player colour.

Once you‚Äôve logged in Foundry will prompt you to pick your player colour.

Pick your colour.

Continue to the next step!

## Step #16 = Request a Character sheet.

Ask on Telegram for a character sheet.

## Step #17 = Open your character sheet.

In the top right corner of your screen on Foundry, there is an ‚Äúactors‚Äù icon.

Click the icon.

Go to the folder of the campaign you‚Äôve joined.

Go to the player active folder.

Your character sheet should be there.

If you are Crimson Throne then:

Crimson Throne Players ‚Üí Open Table | Players Active.

## Step #18= Import your character to Foundry.

Next step.

[Step 21 | Pick a token image.](https://www.notion.so/Step-21-Pick-a-token-image-10b281673a3f4e28adeba7b719f1e816?pvs=21)

Go to Foundry VTT.

Open your sheet.

Drag in feats.

The Pathbuilder importer is broken.

[Making a PC ¬∑ Wiki ¬∑ Hooking / Foundry VTT - Pathfinder 2e](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---pathfinder-2e/-/wikis/Getting-Started-Guide/Making-a-PC#dual-class-pcs)

## Step #19= Pick a token image.

Find an image to be your character's token's image.

This is the image that will represent your character on the virtual tabletop.

Save that image somewhere you can find.

There is a module with thousands of free premium ones on Foundry.

## Step #20 = Send the token image.

Take the token image from the previous step and send it to the Game Master of the campaign.

## Step #21= Request Vision Setup + Token Placement.

Is your screen entirely black?

Then your character has not yet been placed in the current scene.

Request that the Game Master place your token and set up your token‚Äôs vision.

## Step #22 = What you need to know.

Read this page:

[Other Starter Things.](https://www.notion.so/Other-Starter-Things-c8eba2ed98b44e2eb9aa4b84a5107095?pvs=21)

It contains important things you as a player need to know.

There‚Äôs a page that explains how to leave a campaign.

There‚Äôs a page that warns about the possibility of ERP.

There‚Äôs a page that tells you what time zone the campaign is.

There‚Äôs a page about the rune on stating actions.

## Final Steps.

Only step 23 remains.

## Step #23 = Everything might be ready?

Final checks.

Is your character sheet on Foundry populated with all your choices?

Do you have all the optional rules applied to your character‚Äôs build?

Do you have your equipment picked?

Is all your equipment on your character sheet?

Can you move your token to Foundry?

Can you see via your token on Foundry?

Can you turn your token on Foundry?

If you answer all of the above with: ‚ÄúYes‚Äù then you are ready to play in the next session!

You should find your campaigns on this notion on the Path Wars Homepage.

See more pages here.

**And with that, we should be ready to roll the dice, kill shit and have fun.**

## The Old Getting Started Guide.

24/01/2023.

This guide was once 25 separate pages.

I got a lot of feedback that stated that having all these pages being separate was clunky,
hard to navigate and hard to read.

So I have instead made it one longer page.

Hopefully people enjoy this change.
