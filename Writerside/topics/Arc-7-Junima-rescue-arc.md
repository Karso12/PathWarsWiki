# Arc-7-Junima-rescue-arc

Allisee reads the ritual scroll.

This time knowing that her connection to the divine is what must be thought upon.

Allisee does not worship a particular deity, instead allowing her open connection to flow outwards.

Something in Allisee's blood stirs, growls and roars in Allisee's mind: the roar of a dragon.

Allisee, you have awakened something deep within yourself, and within this scroll.
You see the shards of sin glow, though Selenor does not seem to notice.

A beam of light leaps from the scroll, and before you stands this entity:

![DivineSerpent.png](DivineSerpent.png)

She has 7 feathered wings.

She says:

"A banner caller? There is no way, your line is long dead."

She looks curiously at you.

"No, you are something else."

She sees the scroll.

"With the rites of the previous incarnation."

She grabs you a powerful grip, lifting you into the air.
As you move from your previous position, your companions do not notice, as you look down, you see yourself standing 
where you were.

This must be happening only in your mind, or something like that...

"Do you know what you almost did? You nearly called the broken mistress HERE to the plane of hidden, her blood could 
be used to find..."

Her eyes go wide in surprise... and perhaps fear?

"A servant of the moon, a traitor of your blood. How dare you? Is this your feeble attempt to kill me? To kill the 
mistress?"

Her hands start to crush you, she seems to perceive you as the enemy.
